# Desugar

We desugar into a subset of Bluejay so that we have fewer translation cases.

Definitions:
* Paren and bar brackets `(| . |)` is mapping to desugar Bluejay code.
* A tilde `~` prefixes a reserved record label that the programmer cannot create.
* A dollar sign `$` prefixes a fresh name.

# Desugared target

The target of the desugaring can be found pushed in the `main` branch in the Jaylang repo at `src/lang/ast.ml`.

Note that we add `abort`, and `vanish` in this pass, and everything else exists already in Bluejay.

## Statements

Programs are statement lists. Each statement is a let-expression without a continuation.

Statements are desugared exactly like their corresponding let-expressions, except each top-level resulting `let` (e.g. there are many with a recursive function) is its own statement. We need no special cases, and the spec to desugar a statement is inferred from all definitions below and this simple transformation described here.

## Functions

Note that untyped functions are all the same, and we would use untyped let expressions.

### Non-rec functions

```ocaml
(| let f (type a_1 ... a_n) (x_1 : tau_1) ... (x_m : tau_m) : tau =
  e
  in
  e' |) =
let (f : (| (a_1 : type) -> ... -> (a_n : type) -> tau_1 -> ... -> tau_m -> tau |)) = 
  fun a_1 -> ... -> fun a_n ->
    fun x_1 -> ... -> fun x_m ->
      (| e |)
in
(| e' |) 
```

Notes:
* The back arrow is our notation for a dependent parameter.
* Any dependent parameter `(x_i <- tau_i)` is instead in the final arrow type as `... -> (x_1 : tau_i) -> ...`, i.e. the dependent parameters are translated naturally into dependent arrows.
* `n` may be zero (i.e. no type variables), and `m` is positive, as is enforced in the parser.

### Recursive functions

```ocaml
(| let rec f1 (type a1_1 ... a1_n1) (x1_1 : tau1_1) ... (x1_m1 : tau1_m1) : tau1 =
    e1
  and ...
  and fn (type an_1 ... an_nn) (xn_1 : taun_1) ... (xn_mn : taun_mn) : taun =
    en
  in
  e |) =
(* this record is never accessible to the user, so we don't need to create unusable labels *)
let $r = Y_n
  (fun f1 -> ... -> fun fn ->
    let_no_check f1 : (a1_1 : type) -> ... -> (a1_n1 : type) -> tau1_1 -> ... -> tau1_m1 -> tau1 =
      fun a1_1 -> ... -> fun a1_n1 ->
        fun x1_1 -> ... -> fun x1_m1 ->
          (| e1 |)
    in
    f1)
  ...
  (fun f1 -> ... -> fun fn ->
    let_no_check fn : (an_1 : type) -> ... -> (an_nn : type) -> taun_1 -> ... -> taun_mn -> taun =
      fun an_1 -> ... -> fun an_nn ->
        fun xn_1 -> ... -> fun xn_mn ->
          (| en |)
    in
    fn)

(* first expose the names so that the types can use them *)
let f1 = $r.f1
...
let fn = $r.fn
(* then run the checkers on the types, but don't wrap because that would be a double wrap *)
let_no_wrap f1 : (a1_1 : type) -> ... -> (a1_n1 : type) -> tau1_1 -> ... -> tau1_m1 -> tau1 = f1
...
let_no_wrap fn : (an_1 : type) -> ... -> (an_nn : type) -> taun_1 -> ... -> taun_mn -> taun = fn
```

for `Y_n` the fixed point combinator on `n` mutually recursive functions.

```ocaml
Y_n = fun f1 ... fn ->
  Y (fun self f1 ... fn ->
    { l1 = fun x ->
      let r = self f1 ... fn in
      f1 r.l1 ... r.ln x
    ; ...
    ; ln = fun x ->
      let r = self f1 ... fn in
      fn r.l1 ... r.ln x
    }
  ) f1 ... fn

Y = fun f ->
  (fun s -> fun x -> f (s s) x)
  (fun s -> fun x -> f (s s) x)
```

Notes:
* The same notes as non-rec functions...

### Type splayed recursive functions

```ocaml
(| let rec f1 (type a1_1 ... a1_n1) (x1_1 : tau1_1) ... (x1_m1 : tau1_m1) : tau1 =
    e1
  and ...
  and fn (type an_1 ... an_nn) (xn_1 : taun_1) ... (xn_mn : taun_mn) : taun =
    en
  in
  e |) =
(* first generate all the functions, which is recursive in case they refer to each other in their types *)
let $r = Y_n
  (fun f1 -> ... -> fun fn ->
    (* simply a generated member of f1's type *)
    ((a1_1 : type) -> ... -> (a1_n1 : type) -> (| tau1_1 |) -> ... -> (| tau1_m1 |) -> (| tau1 |)).~gen
  )
  ...
  (fun f1 -> ... -> fun fn ->
    ((an_1 : type) -> ... -> (an_nn : type) -> (| taun_1 |) -> ... -> (| taun_mn |) -> (| taun |)).~gen
  )

(* now expose the names so that the types can use them *)
let f1 = $r.f1
...
let fn = $r.fn
(* then actually check and wrap the real implementations, which can call the generated functions above *)
let f1 : (a1_1 : type) -> ... -> (a1_n1 : type) -> tau1_1 -> ... -> tau1_m1 -> tau1 = (| e1 |)
...
let fn : (an_1 : type) -> ... -> (an_nn : type) -> taun_1 -> ... -> taun_mn -> taun = (| en |)
```

Notes:
* Notice that we're looking ahead a bit and calling the `~gen` label here. This is a crossing of boundaries, but it is smooth, so I'm fine with it.
* Each function that does not have types on it is desugared in the normal way.
* We don't escape any determinism blocks, so this is incomplete in the presence of deterministic functions.

#### When we don't allow recursive calls in the types (which is incomplete anyways):

```ocaml
(| let rec f1 (type a1_1 ... a1_n1) (x1_1 : tau1_1) ... (x1_m1 : tau1_m1) : tau1 =
    e1
  and ...
  and fn (type an_1 ... an_nn) (xn_1 : taun_1) ... (xn_mn : taun_mn) : taun =
    en
  in
  e |) =
(* first expose the splayed names so that the first layers can use them *)
let f1 = ((a1_1 : type) -> ... -> (a1_n1 : type) -> (| tau1_1 |) -> ... -> (| tau1_m1 |) -> (| tau1 |)).~gen
...
let fn = ((an_1 : type) -> ... -> (an_nn : type) -> (| taun_1 |) -> ... -> (| taun_mn |) -> (| taun |)).~gen

(* then actually check and wrap the real (first layer) implementations, which can call the generated functions above *)
let f1 : (a1_1 : type) -> ... -> (a1_n1 : type) -> tau1_1 -> ... -> tau1_m1 -> tau1 = (| e1 |)
...
let fn : (an_1 : type) -> ... -> (an_nn : type) -> taun_1 -> ... -> taun_mn -> taun = (| en |)
```

Notes:
* This only works when all recursive functions have types and when the types don't refer to the mutually recursive functions.
* TODO: I haven't actually implemented this yet because it's even more restrictive, but it's what we want to sell in the paper.


### Multi-arg functions

```ocaml
(| fun x1 ... xn -> e |) =
  fun x1 -> ... -> fun xn -> (| e |)
```

## List

```ocaml
let filter_list x =
  match x with
  | `~Nil _ -> x
  | `~Cons _ -> x
  end

(| list |) =
  fun $tau -> mu $t.
  | `~Nil of unit (* This is a unique variant name that the user cannot create, and unit is a dummy payload *)
  | `~Cons of { ~hd : $tau ; ~tl : $t } (* so is this *)

(| x :: xs |) =
  `~Cons { ~hd = (| x |) ; ~tl = filter_list (| xs |) }

(| [] |) =
  `~Nil () 

(| [ x1 ; ... ; xn ] |) =
  (| x1 :: ... :: xn :: [] |)
```

Notes:
* We need to instrument cons because otherwise it always looks well-typed. So we filter all things on the right of `(::)` to be lists.

## Pattern matching

```ocaml
(* Empty list pattern *)
(| [] -pat-> e |) =
  `~Nil -pat-> (| e |)

(* Cons pattern *)
(| hd :: tl -pat-> e |) =
  `~Cons $r -pat-> let hd = $r.~hd in let tl = $r.~tl in (| e |)

(| p -pat-> e |) =
  p -pat-> (| e |)
```

Notes:
* This involves desugaring list patterns, which is why we capture the whole `pat -> expr` instead of pattern and expression separately.
* The semantics of untouchable values is that they only match untouchable patterns and are not capture by `any` or variables, so there is no need to guard those patterns.
* It is a parse error to have any patterns following a catchall pattern (any/_ or an identifier)

## Intersection types

```ocaml
(| ((`V_0 of tau_0) -> tau_0') & ... & ((`V_n of tau_n) -> tau_n') |) =
  (| ($x : `V_0 of tau_0 | ... | `V_n of tau_n) ->
        match $x with
        | `V_0 _ -> tau_0'
        | ...
        | `V_n _ -> tau_n' |)
```

## Assert/assume

### Without forall/exists

```ocaml
(| assert e |) =
  if (| e |)
  then ()
  else abort "Failed assertion"

(| assume e |)
  if (| e |)
  then ()
  else vanish
```

### With forall/exists

```ocaml
(| assert (forall (type a_1 ... a_n) (x_1 : tau_1) ... (x_n : tau_m). e) |) =
  let _ : (a_1 : type) -> ... -> (a_n : type) -> (| tau_1 |) -> ... -> (| tau_m |) -> (| unit |) =
    fun a_1 ... a_n ->
      fun x_1 ... x_m ->
        (| assert e |)
  in
  ()

(| assume (exists (type a_1 ... a_n) (x_1 : tau_1) ... (x_n : tau_m). e) |) =
  let _ : (a_1 : type) -> ... -> (a_n : type) -> (| tau_1 |) -> ... -> (| tau_m |) -> (| unit |) =
    fun a_1 ... a_n ->
      fun x_1 ... x_m ->
        (| assume e |)
  in
  ()
```

Notes:
* Also supports dependent parameters.
* `n` may be zero, and `m` is positive.
* In the case that any type is ill-formed in the `assume`, it will error. The assumption is only on the boolean result and not on the well-formedness of the types.
* There is no meaningful way for this to be interpreted until we get to the embedded language
* We'd like to add intensional equality inside of these, but they can currently be encoded (in a slightly less efficient way) with determinitic functions. It's just a little tricky or extremely wordy to enforce that at parse time.

## And/or

We need to desugar and/or to short-circuit, and this is required so that we can try to solve for the case of the left expression that causes us to evaluate the right expression. This way, in interpretation of the target language, we don't have to think about how the short-circuiting of the boolean operations affects branches.

```ocaml
(| e && e' |) =
  if (| e |)
  then (| e' |)
  else false

(| e || e' |) = 
  if (| e |)
  then true
  else (| e' |)
``` 

## Division/modulo

Division and modulus can go wrong if right expression is `0`. We instrument during the desugar process to add this as a branch in the program.

```ocaml
(| e / e' |) =
  let $v = (| e' |) in (* only evaluate once *)
  if $v == 0
  then abort "Divide by 0"
  else (| e |) / $v

(| e % e' |) =
  let $v = (| e' |) in (* only evaluate once *)
  if $v == 0
  then abort "Modulo by 0"
  else (| e |) % $v
```

## Arrow

```ocaml
(| tau1 -> tau2 |) =
  (| tau1 |) -> (| tau2 |)

(| (x : tau1) -> tau2 |) =
  (x : (| tau1 |)) -> (| tau2 |)
```

## Parse-time

The following desugaring steps are trivial and are done while the program is parsed, so there is no language construct for them.

This is certainly a slight hack, but the scope is small enough that it's fine for now.

### Monadic syntax

```ocaml
(| let%bind x = e in e' |) =
  (| bind e (fun x -> e') |)
```

Notes:
* This implicitly fails if there is no appropriate function called `bind` in scope

### Pipelining

```ocaml
(| e |> e' |) =
  (|  e' e |)
```

Notes:
* This means `e'` is evaluated first, which is a somewhat unintuitive evaluation order, and it motivates actually having the pipelining operator in the language, or desugaring to `(fun a b -> b a) e e'`

### Singlet in module types

```ocaml
(* as a line in a module type *)
(| val t = tau |) =
  (| val t : singlet (tau) |)
```

Notes:
* This is like OCaml's `type t = tau` in a module type. It is simple sugar for the singleton type.

## Conclusion

Unless it was explicitly mentioned in this file, everything else is desugared by just recursively desugaring its components and building back up the same expression.
