(**
   This test module will load a series of test files from the test sources
   directory and execute them one by one.

   Each file is expected to contain a comment describing the expected test
   result.  The comment should be of one of the following forms:

    - [EXPECT-EVALUATE] (which requires that the code evaluates to completion)
    - [EXPECT-STUCK] (which requires that the code gets stuck)
