(*
  There are a ton of members of this type.
  Suppose we cap depth at d

  Then the number of members is described by t is

  || t_d || = f_d (d) where

  f_d(x) =
    1 if x = 0
    sum_(k=0)^d (f_d(x-1))^k otherwise

  So at fixed depth 3, we have
    f_3(0) = 1     -- just the stub
    f_3(1) = 4     -- lists length 0-3 of the stub
    f_3(2) = 1 + 4 + 16 + 64 = 85    -- lists length 0-3, where elements may be any of 4 things
    f_3(3) = 621436
  So || t_3 || = 621436

  But || t_2 || = 13

  This blows up ridiculously fast.

  Currently, the error in this program is not deep, so it is found quickly.

let t = mu t. list t

let f (x : t) : int = 
  match x with
  | [] -> 0
  | hd :: tl ->
    match tl with
    | [] -> 1
    | hd :: tl -> false (* ERROR: not an int *)
    end
  end
