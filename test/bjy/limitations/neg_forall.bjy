(*
  This is semantically well-typed, but it reveals an incompleteness in
  the forall types, and our system claims that this is ill-typed.

  This is a current limitation (or bug, or issue, whatever you may choose
  to call it) in our work.

  The only possible definition of `id` is the identity function, so
  `id int 2` should always be `2`, but we generate a random integer for
  its results, hence allowing us to hit the `else` case.

let _ : ((tau : type) -> tau -> tau) -> unit = 
  fun id ->
    assert (id int 0 == 0)
