let t = { f : (int -> int) | (f 0) == 0 }

(* 
  You might think this should be well-typed, but because functions are
  nondeterministic, the predicate does absolutely nothing, and `f` is
  free to return whatever it wants on any other call.

  Compare this to the well-typed version in the other directory, where
  we write the type as a dependent arrow with a refined codomain.
