(*
  `t` is hard to find with trivial translation.
  We want to be able to type this.

let rec f (x : int) : t {} =
  x

with t _ = int


(*
  A more practical example that tests the same thing is this mutually
  recursive refinement.

let rec g (x : int) : { int | h } =
  x * x + 1

with h (i : int) : bool =
  i > 0
