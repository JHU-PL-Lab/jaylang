(*
  `t` is hard to find with trivial translation.
  We want to be able to type this.
*)

let rec f (x : int) : t {} =
  x

and t _ = int


(*
  A more practical example that tests the same thing is this mutually
  recursive refinement.
*)

let rec g (x : int) : { int | h } =
  x * x + 1

and h (i : int) : bool =
  i > 0
