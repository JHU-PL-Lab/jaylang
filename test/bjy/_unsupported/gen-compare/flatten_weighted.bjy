# flatten the input down to just a list of ints and bools

(*
  I'm not sure how the well-typed version is actually correct here because
  the type changes based on input; so the wrap should be raise a type error
  because we can't really check against this.
  To be clear; when we call `flatten a_ (`L tl)`; the `L tl does not necessarily
  have the same type as the original input.

  So either I am misunderstanding how this will work; or the concolic evaluator
  is not good enough to find this error.

  Here is an example input that should break it.

  `L (
    [ `A a ; `L [ `A a ] ]
  )

  Then tl in the first call ends up as
    [ `L [ `A a ] ]

  so we call   
    flatten a_ (`L [ `L [ `A a ] ])
  
  which has a different type than the original; so I thought that wrap would abort when checking it.

  I have written a refinement that forces this input; and we get no error.

  It seems I'm fighting an unimportant problem. This doesn't matter if it is baked into the gen during the translation.
