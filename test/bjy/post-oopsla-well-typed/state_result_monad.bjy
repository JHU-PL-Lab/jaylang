(*
  This is well-typed because even though it looks like the
  type function `m` is used as `m b` in two places, and those
  are supposed to correspond, this type function `m` is NOT
  GENERATED.

  This is, this program is totally fine because no non-deterministic
  type function is ever made, and instead the type checker uses the
  provided `m`.
