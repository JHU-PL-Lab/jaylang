(*
  The final predicate is hard to check when wrap is on because
  of exponential blowup.

  The `loop (x - 1)` is run twice at each level: once to check
  because it is wrapped, and once to actually use the value.
  This means even `loop 10` is very expensive, and we tend to 
  stop interpretation before it can finish.

  But this is well-typed nevertheless, and the concolic evaluator
  can find it if we let it run somewhere around 300k steps (large, I know).
