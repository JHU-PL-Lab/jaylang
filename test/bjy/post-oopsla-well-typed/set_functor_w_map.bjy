(* Here we extend set_functor_full.bjy to also include a map on the input module.  This is a bit more complex since there are two list types in the general case and it seems like we need to hoist all of that out.  This is a bit gross so there should probably be some sugar for this kind of stuff.  Other cases where we need a special type in the list module for example are zip/unzip, also concat.  Concat would also be desirable on sets. *)
