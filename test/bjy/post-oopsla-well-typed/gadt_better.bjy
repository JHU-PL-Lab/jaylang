(*
  The goal is to emulate the following OCaml GADT

  type _ t =
    | Const : 'a -> 'a t
    | Var : 'a Var.t -> 'a t
    | Plus : int t * int t -> int t
    | Equal : 'a t * 'a t -> bool t

  Note that the 'a inside of Equal is a forall. That is, Equal
  is like a function that works on all 'a. Then, any value that
  is created with the Equal constructor has an existential 'a,
  so we model this with a dependent record.

  The general idea is to make a universe type `ty` on which we can
  match in order to constrain each constructor. We will introduce
  the constructors and then match on the member of `ty`, diverging
  (i.e. quitting safely) if it is incompatible with this constructor.

  There is then no need for a `'a` member of `ty` because we can
  simply leave it unconstrained.

  This feels strictly nicer than the "ugly" encoding we have, which
  is also a test in this directory.
