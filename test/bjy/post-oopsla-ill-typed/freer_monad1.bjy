(*
  We have no need for a functor here because we have higher order type parameters.
  In OCaml for a freer monad, we'd have to use a functor and pass in `f` inside a module.

  This test is inspired by the Preface library.

let perform 
  : (a : type) -> (f : ty1) -> f a -> t f a
  = fun a f fa ->
  `Bind { b = a ; intermediate = fa ; cont = fun a -> `Return a }

(*
  There error boils down to here, where we have a type function on two parameters,
  but we want it to be a type function on one parameter that returns a type with
  one more parameter than this has.

  A types as values issue, I'd argue. If we just partially apply in the types in `run`,
  we would be trying to generate a member of a function.
  It's also a usage error, but usage errors on generated functions aren't typically
  categorized as such because the error shows up whether wrap is on or not.

let handler 
  : ty1 --> type --> type
  = fun f a ->
    (b : type) -> (a -> b) -> f a -> b

(*
  This doesn't work because the handler actually needs to be a `handler f b` if defined this
  way, but we don't know `b` until we have found it inside `Bind`.

  Thus the definition of the handler is wrong if we want to use it here.

    match x with
    | `Return a -> a
