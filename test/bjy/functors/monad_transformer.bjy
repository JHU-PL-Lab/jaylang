(*
  This is not exactly practical because T doesn't know anything about M and thus is useless.
  I'm trying to make a case for needing higher-kinded type parameters, but it seems they are
  all basically unusable.
    * We would need to pass in the behavior to each function (here `lift` in order for it to
      do anything), which is annoying and better done as a functor in any case I can think of.
    * Or we would need Haskell typeclasses, which obviously we don't have.

(* ERROR: multiple applications of m a go wrong because of nondeterminism of generated functions *)
