    module type BASIC = sig
      type 'a m
      val return : 'a -> 'a m
      val join   : 'a m m -> 'a m
      val map    : 'a m -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'b m
    end


    module Derive_bind (M : BASIC) = struct
      include M
      let bind x f = M.join (M.map x f)
    end

  IMPORTANT:
    This code *looks* like it is well-typed, and indeed it will behave
    correctly without types, but we cannot type-check it.

(*
  The following is my most ideal, OCaml-like Bluejay code, but it doesn't work.
*)

let BASIC =
  {: m : type -> type
  ;  map  : (a : type) -> (b : type) -> m a -> (a -> b) -> m b
  ;  join : (a : type) -> m (m a) -> m a
  ;  return : (a : type) -> a -> m a
  :}

(* this works well *)
let (Id_example : BASIC) =
  let m a = ``Id a in
  { m = m
  ; map = fun a b x f ->
      match x with
      | `Id z -> `Id (f z)
      end
  ; join = fun a x ->
      match x with
      | `Id m -> m
      end
  ; return = fun a x -> `Id x
  }

(*
  This doesn't work because the checker for the functions M.join and M.map use different instances
  of the application `M.m a`, or similar, than what is in the return type of this Derive_bind.
 *)
let Derive_bind (M <- BASIC) : { bind : (a : type) -> (b : type) -> let mb = M.m b in M.m a -> (a -> mb) -> mb } =
  { bind = fun a b x f -> M.join b (M.map a (M.m b) x f)
  }

(*
  Ideally, we can get rid of the `let mb = ...`, which would have the following code (which still cannot type check)
*)
let Derive_bind (M <- BASIC) : { bind : (a : type) -> (b : type) -> M.m a -> (a -> M.m b) -> M.m b } =
  { bind = fun a b x f -> M.join b (M.map a (M.m b) x f)
  }
