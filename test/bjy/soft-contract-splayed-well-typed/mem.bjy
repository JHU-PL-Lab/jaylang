(*
  The problem is the recursive call. The recursive call just makes an int list using recursive mem as 
  a predicate, which obviously cannot work.

  But since it should always find the item at the front of the list, I feel like this should work. I think
  it has to do with generating the list for the recursive call, which is unconstrained until it calls mem
  on it, which will need to generate a boolean. We'd have to push the refinement into the list parameter for
  this to work, which is not in the spirit of the test.
