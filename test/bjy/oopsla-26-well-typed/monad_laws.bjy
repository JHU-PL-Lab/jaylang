  These are the three monad laws.

    Left identity:
    For all types 'a, 'b, and a in 'a, and h in 'a -> m 'b,
      bind 'a 'b (return 'a a) h === h a

    Right identity:
    For all types 'a, and a_m in m 'a,
      bind 'a 'a a_m (return 'a) === a_m

    Associativity:
    For all types 'a, 'b, 'c, and a_m in m 'a, and g in 'a -> m 'b, and h in 'b -> m 'c,
      bind 'b 'c (bind 'a 'b a_m g) h === bind 'a 'c a_m (fun x -> bind 'b 'c (g x) h)

  We know that the types will come out to be the same, and we want to verify that the values
  are the same. This requires polymorphic equality. We have such a thing with deterministic functions,
  so we simply ask if a deterministic function can tell them apart.

  We will only be able to type check monads where intensional equality is enough. It is
  not enough for a state monad; the state monad is an example of incompleteness.

let MONAD = { M : sig

  val return : (a : type) -> a -> m a
  val bind : (a : type) -> (b : type) -> m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
end | (* now let's refine M to be only one where the laws hold *)
  (*
    This checks the first law by ensuring that any deterministic function acting on the output 
    cannot tell them apart. Since our deterministic functions are sound (but not always complete),
    this forces the law to hold.
    We do the same thing for the other two laws.

    Note that these functions `g` and `h` need to be deterministic or else we can't check something like the Option monad.

(*
  Because our intensional equality for deterministic functions causes incompleteness, we cannot verify the laws on this one.
  The values on each side of the law are operationally equivalent but not intensionally equivalent.

  The system therefore calls this ill-typed.
  It is commented in this well-typed version. There is an ill-typed test that has it.

(*
  Note that we can generate a member of MONAD. This line works just fine.
  Actually it doesn't because we fail assertions we generating.
  We would like to be able to "assume forall" when generating, but this just
  theoretically isn't possible. We can only "assert forall", which makes sense
  when checking but isn't good when generating.
