(*
  We build a function that takes n types and makes a function type form them

  It's relatively unhelpful because we might as well just write the function
  type by hand when used this way, or just pass in a list of types to be made into
  the function type.

  But I'm sure there's some cool stuff we can do with this dynamically.
