(*
  Takes a module type and returns a module type.
  While OCaml has parametric polymorphism for types, it doesn't
  have parametrized module types, so it can't do this.

  Since our module types are just like any other type, we can do this.
  However, we can't go a level higher. We don't have a way to say
    NEST : (S : module type) -> ...
  We could say
    NEST : (S : type) -> ...
  but we can't refine it down to be only a module type.

let NEST S = sig
  val Inner : S

let MONOID = sig
  val t : type
  val neutral : t
  val combine : t -> t -> t
end

let Int : MONOID = struct
  let t = int
  let neutral : t = 0
  let combine : t -> t -> t = fun a b -> a + b
end

let X : NEST MONOID = struct
  let Inner = Int
end
