  Purpose: handle logic between each interpretation

  Detailed description:
    This session holds the queue of targets, and it accepts the
    result of evaluations (see [accum_eval]), adds them to the queues,
    and then can tell whether to proceed with more evaluations of the
    program or to quit.

    The evaluator interfaces with this instead of the underlying queues.
    It is mainly just a layer on top of the queues with a few extra
    details about the status of evaluation.

module Make : functor (_ : Solve.S) (P : Pause.S) (_ : Options.V) -> sig
  type t
  (** [t] holds program info between interpretations and helps generate the evaluation session
      for the next run. *)

  val empty : t
  (** [empty] is a default empty session *)

  val accum_eval : t -> Status.Eval.t -> t
  (** [accum_eval t status] accumulates the resulting [status] into [t]. *)

  val next : t -> [ `Done of Status.Terminal.t | `Next of (t * Eval_session.t) ] P.t
  (** [next t] is [`Done status] if the concolic evaluation is done, or is [`Next (session, eval_session)]
  if the interpreter is to be run again with the [eval_session] session. *)

  val run_num : t -> int
  (** [run_num t] is the number of interpretations [t] has done. *)
