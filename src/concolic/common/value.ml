      We want to only restore to the desired snapshot when needed. 
      Therefore, if we go into a snapshot, don't use it, and pop
      back out, then there is nothing to do.

      If we *do* use it, then we need to restore on both sides (entering
      and exiting).

      If we are nested, then how are we supposed to know which snapshot
      needed to be restored? We need a parallel stack (or make it a stack
      of tuples) telling use whether we have restored that.

      In fact a stack is not sufficient. Sometimes we capture not because
      we are about to enter a new state (like about to eval a function
      application), but instead because we are *creating* the closure.

      So the stack is *only* for entering a new state and then popping back
      to the old one. So maybe a stack is sufficient.

      We can have an Env.local function to say locally do all of this
      stuff, and at the end pop back. We also only want to take as many
      snapshots as we need, so we should hold off on taking a snapshot until
      the environment changes. This is actually a very tough question.
      Maybe I need to look into the research for efficient environment management.

      We want to limit our snapshots because each snapshot makes it more expensive
      to restore to other snapshots. So when we choose to evaluate a function
      locally, we should only take the snapshot right before we *change* a cell.
      If we are simply creating a cell, then that doesn't affect the snapshot
      because restoring a snap doesn't destroy new cells. Thus this implementation
      cannot and will never be correct with respect to free variables.

      So when we enter a local computation, set a flag (we're not considering nestedness yet)
      that says to take the snapshot before we change an existing cell. If we are
      about to read from a cell, then we need to restore the state to whatever state
      the local computation wants, which also means we need to take the snapshot right
      before that.
      I think to be careful about *which* cells really need to be restored, we would
      need some alias analysis, which is hard, so I'll ignore that.
      And then when we exit the local computation, we only restore the original state
      if the computation took a snapshot.
